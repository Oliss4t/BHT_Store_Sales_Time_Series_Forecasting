# BHT_Store_Sales_Time_Series_Forecasting

This is a project done in the learning optimazation class.
The data is from a previous kaggel competition: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/store-sales-time-series-forecasting/overview/frequently-asked-questions

The final report is the [Learning_Optimazation_Report.pdf](./Learning_Optimazation_Report.pdf)

* The EDA + Exponential Smoothing + Double Exponential Smoothing and SARIMA model can be found [here](./EDA_and_preprocessing.ipynb)
* The Prophet model was build [here](./prophet.ipynb)
* The Tree base models were build [here](./Decision Tree and Random Forest.ipynb)
* The creation of the distribution for Top-Down approach can be found [here](./Distribution for Top-Down Approach)

Project focal points:

* Demand Forecasting / Time Series Forecasting
* Feature Engineering
* Hyperparameter Tuning as Optimization
* Model Selection as Optimization

The project should focus on at least one of the following three tasks: 
* comparing different time series forecasting models
* optimizing the hyperparameters of a ML or Deep Neural Network
* automizing the model selection

# BHT_Store_Sales_Time_Series_Forecasting

This is a project done in the learning optimazation class.
The data is from a previous kaggel competition: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/store-sales-time-series-forecasting/overview/frequently-asked-questions

Project focal points:

* Demand Forecasting / Time Series Forecasting
* Feature Engineering
* Hyperparameter Tuning as Optimization
* Model Selection as Optimization

The project should focus on at least one of the following three tasks: 
* comparing different time series forecasting models
* optimizing the hyperparameters of a ML or Deep Neural Network
* automizing the model selection
